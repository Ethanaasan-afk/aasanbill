        <ul>
          <li>
            New accounts start with a <strong>14-day free trial</strong>, with no
            payment required.
          </li>
          <li>You may cancel anytime during the trial with no charge.</li>
          <li>
            If you do not cancel before the trial ends, you will be prompted to
            choose a paid plan to continue using the Service; no automatic charge
            is made without your explicit action to subscribe.

            You may cancel your subscription at any time from{" "}
            <strong>Settings → Billing</strong> within the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you cancel, your subscription remains active until the end of
            your current billing period (monthly or annual, whichever you&apos;re
            on) - you will continue to have full access until then.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the billing period ends, your account will move to a
            restricted/read-only state: you can view and export your existing
            data, but cannot create new invoices or add new records until you
            resubscribe.

      <LegalSection id="refunds" title="3. Refunds">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Monthly plans:</strong> Fees already paid for the current
            month are non-refundable, but you will not be charged again after
            cancellation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Annual plans:</strong> If you cancel within the first 7 days
            of starting or renewing an annual plan, you are eligible for a full
            refund. After 7 days, annual fees are non-refundable, but your
            subscription remains active for the full period already paid for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Billing errors:</strong> If you were charged incorrectly
            (e.g., duplicate charge, wrong plan amount), contact us within 30 days
            of the charge and we will investigate and issue a full refund for the
            erroneous amount if confirmed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refunds, where applicable, are processed back to the original payment
            method via Razorpay and typically take 5–7 business days to reflect,
            depending on your bank.

          If you downgrade from a higher plan to a lower one, the change takes
          effect at the start of your next billing cycle. We do not provide
          partial refunds for the unused portion of a higher-tier plan when
          downgrading mid-cycle.
